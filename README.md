# hashcode_pizza_practice
In this repo I try to solve the practice problem for the Google Hash Code 2019 competition. My current approach is a simple backtracking algorithm.

To build the C++ binary on linux simply run 
`sh build.sh`

On Windows systems please enter this into the command line 
`g++ main.cpp -o main -O0 -std=c++14`

The binary is built with the C++14 standard, No optimizations, and a GCC compiler.

My scores for the various input files are as follows:

Eg.in => 6<br />
Small.in => 22<br />
Medium.in => 40488<br />
Big.in => 667798<br />

**Total => 708314**
