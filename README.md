# hashcode_pizza_practice
In this repo I try to solve the practice problem for the Google Hash Code 2019 competition. My current approach is a simple backtracking algorithm.

To build the C++ binary on linux simply run `sh build.sh`

On Windows systems please enter this commain into the command line `g++ main.cpp -o main -O0 -std=c++14`

The binary is build with the C++14 standard and No optimizations with a GCC compiler
